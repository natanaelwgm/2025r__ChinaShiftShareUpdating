# data_work/output

Final deliverables generated by the pipeline.

Common artefacts:

- `results/main_p{0,1,2}.csv` – Regression grids covering all flows × IVs × periods with coefficients, SEs, diagnostics.
- `results/first_stage.csv` – Partial-F statistics and first-stage R² per specification.
- `tables/p0-p1-p2_batch.html` – HTML “spec booklet” produced by `scripts/export_tables_batch.py`.
- `tables/{outcome}_{flow}_{partner}_etable.{html,tex}` – Optional etables emitted by `scripts/R/run_etable.R`.
- `diagnostics/validation_report.json` – Summary of validation metrics (share sums, instrument coverage, counts).

Everything here is safe to delete and regenerate—just rerun the orchestrator or the exporter scripts.  
If you need to publish tables, copy them out of this directory rather than versioning them in Git.
