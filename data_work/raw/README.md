# data_work/raw

Staging area for the *raw* synthetic extracts generated by the orchestrator.

Expected contents (all ignored by Git):

- `trade_hs_year_YYYY.csv` – HS6 trade values by partner/flow (nominal + deflator).
- `sakernas_micro_year_YYYY.csv` – Synthetic worker-level employment draws.
- `susenas_micro_year_YYYY.csv` – Synthetic household-level income and demographics.

Files are recreated on every `Rscript scripts/R/orchestrate.R run`.  
If you swap to real data, keep the same naming pattern or adjust the reader in `scripts/R/orchestrate.R` accordingly.

> **Do not commit** the actual CSVs—store heavy upstream data in a cloud bucket instead. This README exists solely to keep the directory in Git for documentation.
